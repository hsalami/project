Tableau Assignment - Introduction to Tableau
---------------------------------------------


**PRACTICUM [GROUP]** - Take 90 minutes to answer the following questions. Once 
you have finished we will ask for volunteers and discuss responses as a group.


A) Import the coffee_chain_2 data into Tableau. Note that a CSV is a 'Text
   File'.

B) Change the number of rows visible in Tableau from 1,000 to 2,212.

C) Click 'Manage Metadata' to get a summary of the data types you will be
   working with. Note the icons that correspond to each data type.

D) Open up a new worksheet, locate the 'Measure Names' and 'Measure Values'
   pills and place them into the 'Columns' and 'Rows' fields, to create a quick
   overview.

E) Create a visualization of the "sum of sales" per market. What is the most
   lucrative market? What is the least lucrative market? 

   Answer: Drag the 'Market' pill to Columns and the 'Sales' pill to rows and
   select a bar graph. You will quickly see that the West market has the highest
   sales and the South market the lowest.

F) Create a visualization to show the Average value of the sales in each market.
   What market has the highest average value? What market has the lowest average
   value? 

   Answer: Right click on the Sales pill already in Rows, click on Measure (Sum)
   and select average from the dropdown menu. The East market has the highest
   average sales and the South market the lowest average sales.

G) Use the 'Show Me' tool to transform the two visualizations from the previous
   exercises into a table, a treemap, a bubble chart and a pie chart. Which of 
   these visualizations do you prefer for conveying this information and why?

H) Create a line chart showing the sum of sales over time. What date had the
   highest sales and what date the lowest?

   Answer: Drag the 'Date' pill to columns, the sum of 'Sales' to rows and 
   select 'Line' from the 'Marks' box or the 'Show Me' menu. December 1st 2013 
   had the highest sales and December 1st 2012 had the lowest.

I) Drag the 'Total Expenses' pill to 'Rows' to create a second line graph in the
   same visualization. Would adding the line to the same axis help compare the
   values in each?

   Answer: Yes, on the same axis the sales and total expenses would be easier to
   compare.

J) Put the 'Total Expenses' and 'Sales' lines on one chart for easier
   comparison.

   Answer: Drag the 'Total Expenses' pill from 'Rows' to the y-axis label in 
   the first line graph. When an image of two green bars appears, release the
   mouse button.

K) Use a visualization to find out what product sells best and has the highest
   profit margins.

   Answer: 

   1) Drag the 'Product' pill to 'Columns and the 'Sales' and 'Margin' pills to
      rows. Select 'Side by Side Bars' from the 'Show Me' menu. 
   
   2) Drag the 'Sales' pill to 'Columns', the 'Product' pill to rows and the
      'Margin' pill to the 'Color' icon in the 'Marks' box.

   Colombian coffee has the highest sales and the highest margins.


L) Create a map showing sales in every area code and the market it is
   associated with. 

   Answer: Drag the 'Area Code' pill to Columns, the 'Sales' pill to Rows and
   select 'Symbol Maps' from the 'Show Me' menu. Drag the 'Market' pill to
   colors to show what market the area code is associated with.

M) Assume the role of a coffee shop executive ask the questions that such an
   executive may ask and try to answer them with the data available and your
   data visualization / Tableau skills. Present your questions and findings to 
   the class.
