Tableau Assignment - Customer Segmentation
--------------------------------------------

**PRACTICUM [GROUP]** - Take 90 minutes to answer the following questions. Once
you have finished we will ask for volunteers and discuss responses as a group.

You are working on a marketing team at a bank and have been tasked with 
creating a dashboard that will help executives explore different customer 
segments. Utilizing the customers.csv data create, up to 5 visualizations that 
break down customers in a variety of ways. Some ideas might be age, gender,
country, balance, type of job, etc. You should combine the visualizations into 
an interactive dashboard - meaning use some views as filters for other views,
or use parameters. This is meant to be a more open ended assignment, but some
questions you could explore are: 

   | What do high balance customers look like (where do they live, work, how 
     old are they, etc.)?
   | What characteristics do our blue collar customers have?
   | What is the makeup of customers with small balances?
   | What are characteristics of customers who have had an account opened for
     less than 1yr?

Explore the data and highlight or provide solutions for any interesting things
that you find.
