Tableau Assignment - Dynamic Quadrant Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**PRACTICUM [GROUP]** - Take 90 minutes to answer the following questions. Once you have finished we will ask for volunteers and discuss responses as a group.


A) Import the Sample-Superstore data into the Tableau workspace from the computer, and create a connection to the Orders table.


B) Open up a new worksheet and create a new calculated field called Revenue per Unit, similar to the Profit Ratio calculated field we created during the lesson. In this case we want ``SUM[A]/SUM[B]`` where A and B will give us the revenue per unit.	
	

C) Create a scatter plot using this new field, Revenue per Unit, in the columns bar and the SUM of sales in the rows bar. Use the subcategory field as the label.

   1) What is the subcategory with the highest sales per unit?
   2) How much revenue per unit does this subcategory generate?


D) Create a parameter for Sales and Revenue per Unit (right click on the pills, create parameter). The sales parameter should be set to $150K and the RPU parameter should be set to $100.


E) Add these parameters as reference lines on the proper axis. What names would you give to each quadrant to describe its members?


F) Change the shape on the scatter plot to filled circles.


G) Color the categories according the the quadrant that they are in. Create a new calculated field called QuadColor and add in the formula below, then drag it to the color mark: ::

     IF  [Revenue Per Unit] >= [Revenue Per Unit Parameter]  
     AND SUM([Sales]) > [Sales Parameter] THEN 'UPPER RIGHT'  
     ELSEIF [Revenue Per Unit] < [Revenue Per Unit Parameter]   
     AND SUM([Sales]) > [Sales Parameter] THEN 'UPPER LEFT'  
     ELSEIF [Revenue Per Unit] > [Revenue Per Unit Parameter]   
     AND SUM([Sales]) < [Sales Parameter] THEN 'BOTTOM RIGHT'  
     ELSE 'BOTTOM LEFT'  
     END


H) Create an action (worksheet |srarr| action) to make your parameters dynamic. Go to Worksheet |srarr| Actions... and add two new Actions.
   
   1) A Sales Action that has the target parameter as Sales Parameter, and Value Field of SUM Sales
   2) A RPU Action that has the target parameter as Revenue per Unit Parameter and Value Field of AGG Revenue Per Unit


I) Filter your resulting dynamic quadrant chart to show only the states of Arizona, California, and Colorado.

   1) What is the highest selling item in these 3 states combined, and what were the total sales for this item?
   2) What item generates the lowest Revenue Per Unit, and what is the Sales amount generated by this item?


J) Save your work to your Tableau Public account and paste the link to your workbook below:
